# 🔄 Agent Enhancement: Before & After Comparison

## Visual Impact Analysis

This document provides concrete examples of how your agent will behave differently after the enhancements.

---

## Example 1: Coach Contact Request

### User Question:
> "I want to reach out to the University of Michigan softball coaches. Can you help me get their contact info?"

### ❌ BEFORE (Current Implementation)

**Agent Response:**
> "Absolutely! To find the University of Michigan softball coaching staff contact information, I'd recommend visiting their official athletic website. You can usually find coach emails and contact forms in the staff directory. Start by going to mgoblue.com and navigating to the softball section. Look for 'Staff Directory' or 'Contact Us' pages. Most colleges list their coaching staff there with email addresses.
>
> When you reach out, make sure to introduce yourself professionally with your grad year, position, and key stats. Good luck!"

**Problems:**
- ❌ Doesn't actually provide the contact info
- ❌ Tells user to do the work themselves
- ❌ No search was performed despite having the tool
- ❌ Generic advice instead of specific help

---

### ✅ AFTER (Enhanced Implementation)

**Agent Response:**
> "I'll search for the Michigan softball coaching staff contact information right now.
>
> [Search performed: "University of Michigan softball coaching staff directory email 2025"]
>
> Here's the current coaching staff contact info:
>
> **Head Coach: Carol Hutchins** (if still current)
> - Email: chutch@umich.edu
> - Office: (734) 647-XXXX
>
> **Assistant Coach: [Name]**
> - Email: [email]@umich.edu
>
> **Recruiting Coordinator: [Name]**
> - Email: [email]@umich.edu
>
> You can find the full directory at: [Michigan Athletics Official Page]
>
> **Your outreach strategy:** Start with the recruiting coordinator, then follow up with the head coach. Use the subject line '[Grad Year] [Position] - [Your Name] Recruiting Interest.' Want me to help you draft that email?
>
> ---
> **Sources:**
> 1. https://mgoblue.com/sports/softball/roster/coaches
> 2. https://mgoblue.com/staff-directory"

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Proactively searches for information
- ✅ Provides actual contact details
- ✅ Cites official sources
- ✅ Adds strategic advice on HOW to use the info
- ✅ Offers to help with next step

## Example 2: Recruiting Rules Question

### User Question:
> "When is the NCAA dead period for Division 1 basketball?"

### ❌ BEFORE

**Agent Response:**
> "The NCAA has specific dead periods throughout the year for Division 1 basketball recruiting. These are times when coaches cannot have in-person contact with recruits. The dead periods typically occur during certain weeks, but the exact dates can vary by year and are usually set by the NCAA.
>
> I'd recommend checking the NCAA's official website for the most current calendar, as these dates can change. You can find this information in the Division 1 recruiting calendar section on NCAA.org."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Doesn't provide actual dates
- ❌ Vague ("certain weeks", "can vary")
- ❌ Passes responsibility to user
- ❌ No verification of current year information

---

### ✅ AFTER

**Agent Response:**
> "Let me get you the exact dates from the current NCAA calendar.
>
> [Search performed: "NCAA Division 1 basketball recruiting dead period 2025"]
>
> **2025 Division 1 Basketball Dead Periods:**
>
> - **[Specific dates]:** [Details from search]
> - **[Specific dates]:** [Details from search]
>
> **What this means for you:** During dead periods, coaches can't meet with you in person, but they CAN still communicate via phone, email, and text. This is actually a great time to send highlight films and schedule phone calls since coaches are in the office more.
>
> **Pro tip:** Mark these dates in your calendar and plan your campus visits around them. Want to know about contact periods too?
>
> ---
> **Sources:**
> 1. https://ncaa.org/sports/2024/5/15/division-i-recruiting-calendars.aspx
> 2. [Official NCAA Calendar PDF]
>
> *Information current as of October 15, 2025*"

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Provides exact, current dates
- ✅ Searches for most recent information
- ✅ Explains practical implications
- ✅ Offers strategic advice on what to do during dead periods
- ✅ Timestamps information for currency
- ✅ Cites official NCAA sources

---

## Example 3: Best Programs Question

### User Question:
> "What are the best schools for lacrosse in the Northeast?"

### ❌ BEFORE

**Agent Response:**
> "The Northeast has some of the strongest lacrosse programs in the country! Schools like Johns Hopkins, Syracuse, Duke (which is more Mid-Atlantic), Princeton, Yale, Cornell, and Penn State are traditionally very strong.
>
> For Division 1 programs, you'll want to look at schools in conferences like the ACC, Ivy League, and Patriot League. Each school has different strengths - some are better for attack players, others for defense or goalies.
>
> What position do you play? That'll help me give you more specific recommendations."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Based on general knowledge (might be outdated)
- ❌ Duke example shows uncertainty ("which is more Mid-Atlantic")
- ❌ No current rankings or performance data
- ❌ No sources to verify information

---

### ✅ AFTER

**Agent Response:**
> "Let me pull the latest rankings and program performance data for Northeast lacrosse.
>
> [Searches performed:
> 1. "Top Division 1 lacrosse programs Northeast 2024 rankings"
> 2. "NCAA lacrosse Northeast championship appearances 2024"]
>
> **Top Northeast D1 Lacrosse Programs (2024 Rankings):**
>
> 1. **Johns Hopkins** - Consistently ranked Top 5, [X] NCAA championships
> 2. **Syracuse** - Powerhouse program, recent Final Four appearances
> 3. **Princeton** - Ivy League leader, [X] conference titles
> 4. **Cornell** - Strong defensive tradition, Top 20 ranked
> 5. **Yale** - Rising program, [X] recent NCAA tournament bids
>
> **Program Strengths by Position:**
> - **Attack:** Syracuse (led nation in scoring 2024)
> - **Defense:** Johns Hopkins (fewest goals allowed in conference)
> - **Goalie:** Cornell (produced 3 All-Americans in last 5 years)
>
> **Next Steps:** Want me to search for coaching staff contacts at your top 3 choices? What's your position and grad year?
>
> ---
> **Sources:**
> 1. https://www.insidelacrosse.com/college-rankings
> 2. https://ncaa.com/sports/lacrosse-men/d1
> 3. [ACC/Ivy League standings pages]"

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Uses current rankings, not memory
- ✅ Provides specific data points (championships, rankings)
- ✅ Breaks down by position with evidence
- ✅ Cites multiple authoritative sources
- ✅ Offers concrete next steps

## Example 4: Multi-Part Complex Question

### User Question:
> "Tell me about the volleyball recruiting timeline for D1, and which schools in California have good programs."

### ❌ BEFORE

**Agent Response:**
> "Great question! For Division 1 volleyball recruiting, the timeline is pretty competitive. Generally, recruiting starts early - many players commit in their sophomore or junior year of high school. Official visits can happen starting September 1 of your junior year.
>
> California has tons of strong volleyball programs! Stanford, UCLA, USC, Cal Berkeley, and Pepperdine are all nationally competitive. UC schools like Irvine, Santa Barbara, and San Diego also have solid programs.
>
> The key is to start your recruiting process early. Build your highlight film, attend showcases, and start emailing coaches by your sophomore year if possible."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Generic timeline (might not reflect current rules)
- ❌ Lists schools from memory (rankings could be outdated)
- ❌ No specific coach contacts
- ❌ Single-response approach doesn't fully address both parts

---

### ✅ AFTER

**Agent Response:**
> "This is a two-part question, so let me search for both pieces of information.
>
> [Searches performed:
> 1. "NCAA Division 1 volleyball recruiting timeline 2025 rules"
> 2. "Top Division 1 volleyball programs California rankings 2024"]
>
> ## Part 1: D1 Volleyball Recruiting Timeline
>
> **Current NCAA Rules (2025):**
> - **June 15 before junior year:** Coaches can call/text
> - **September 1 of junior year:** Official visits allowed
> - **Peak recruiting period:** Junior summer through senior fall
> - **Signing periods:** [Specific dates from search]
>
> **Reality Check:** Top programs often have verbal commits by end of sophomore year, but walk-on and scholarship opportunities exist through senior year.
>
> ## Part 2: Top California D1 Programs
>
> **Current Top 10 (2024 Season):**
> 1. **Stanford** (#1 ranked, [X] national championships)
> 2. **UCLA** (#3 ranked, Pac-12 leaders)
> 3. **USC** (#7 ranked, strong recruiting class 2024)
> 4. **Pepperdine** (#12, WCC powerhouse)
> 5. **Cal Berkeley** (#15, consistent Top 25)
> 6. **UC San Diego** (Rising program, moved to D1 in [year])
>
> **Program Characteristics:**
> - **Academic + Athletic:** Stanford, UCLA, Cal
> - **Smaller school:** Pepperdine
> - **Strong club program connections:** USC, UCLA
>
> ## Your Action Plan:
> 1. **This week:** Create recruiting timeline targeting these schools
> 2. **This month:** Email 5-8 coaches from this list
> 3. **Next:** Want me to search for specific coach contacts at your top 3 choices?
>
> ---
> **Sources:**
> 1. https://ncaa.org/sports/volleyball-women/d1-recruiting-calendar
> 2. https://www.avca.org/rankings
> 3. https://pac-12.com/volleyball/standings
> 4. Individual school athletic department sites
>
> *Information current as of October 15, 2025*"

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Performs multiple targeted searches** to fully address question
- ✅ **Structures response clearly** (Part 1, Part 2, Action Plan)
- ✅ **Provides current, verified data** for both timeline and programs
- ✅ **Includes context** ("Reality Check" section)
- ✅ **Cites multiple sources** for different info types
- ✅ **Offers concrete next steps** based on the information

## Example 5: Error Handling Scenario

### Scenario: Search API is temporarily down

### User Question:
> "What are the contact rules for NAIA softball recruiting?"

### ❌ BEFORE

**Agent Response:**
> [Error occurs, task fails or returns generic error message]
> "An error occurred. Please try again."

**Problems:**
- ❌ Unhelpful error message
- ❌ No fallback information
- ❌ User left with no guidance

---

### ✅ AFTER

**Agent Response:**
> "I attempted to search for the most current NAIA recruiting rules, but I'm unable to access live search results at the moment. Let me provide you with general guidance based on my training data, but please note this should be verified with official NAIA sources.
>
> **NAIA Recruiting (General Framework - Verify Current Rules):**
>
> NAIA has more relaxed contact rules compared to NCAA:
> - Coaches can typically contact prospects earlier
> - Fewer restrictions on contact periods
> - More flexibility with official visits
> - Different dead period structure
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Because I can't verify the current year's specific dates and rules, I recommend:
> 1. Visit PlayNAIA.org/recruiting-calendar for the official 2025 rules
> 2. Call the NAIA Eligibility Center: [phone number]
> 3. Ask the specific coaches you're interested in about their contact policies
>
> **What I CAN help with right now:**
> - Email outreach strategy (not time-sensitive)
> - Profile building guidance
> - General recruiting process advice
>
> Would you like help with any of those while the search functionality is restored? Or I can try the search again in a few minutes."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** - still provides value despite error
- ✅ **Transparency** - explicitly states limitations
- ✅ **Clear disclaimer** - user knows info needs verification
- ✅ **Provides alternative resources** - direct user to official sources
- ✅ **Offers other assistance** - shows what agent CAN still do
- ✅ **Maintains helpful tone** - doesn't just give up

## Side-by-Side: Search Tool Description

### ❌ BEFORE

```python
FunctionDeclaration(
    name="google_search",
    description="This is a tool for searching the internet for up-to-date information.",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The query to search for"
            }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
    },
)
```

**Problems:**
- Too generic ("up-to-date information")
- No guidance on WHEN to use
- No guidance on HOW to formulate queries
- Model under-utilizes due to lack of clarity

---

### ✅ AFTER

```python
FunctionDeclaration(
    name="google_search",
    description=(
        "Searches the internet for current, factual information about college athletics recruiting, "
        "coach contact information, program statistics, recruiting rules, deadlines, and recent news. "

        "**WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:**\n"
        "- User asks about specific colleges, coaches, or athletic programs\n"
        "- User needs current recruiting deadlines, rules, or regulations (NCAA/NAIA)\n"
        "- User asks 'what are the best schools for [sport/position]'\n"
        "- User needs coach contact information (emails, phone numbers)\n"
        "- User asks about recent program achievements, rankings, or news\n"
        "- Any question requiring facts from after your knowledge cutoff\n"
        "- When you're uncertain about specific data (don't guess!)\n\n"

        "**SEARCH QUERY BEST PRACTICES:**\n"
        "- Be specific: Instead of 'football recruiting', use 'Division 1 football recruiting rules 2025'\n"
        "- Include relevant context: '[Sport] [Division] [College Name] coach contact'\n"
        "- Use official terminology: 'NCAA Division 1', 'NAIA', 'commitment period'\n"
        "- For coach info: '[College] [Sport] coaching staff email' or '[Coach Name] [College] contact'\n"
        "- For rankings: '[Sport] college rankings 2025' or '[Conference] standings 2024'\n\n"

        "**MULTIPLE SEARCHES:**\n"
        "You can call this tool multiple times in one turn if needed. For complex questions, "
        "break them into focused searches (e.g., one for rules, one for coach contacts).\n\n"

        "**IMPORTANT:** Always search when you need current information. Don't rely on potentially "
        "outdated knowledge. The user is counting on accurate, up-to-date advice."
    ),
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": (
                    "The specific, detailed search query. Be precise and include all relevant context "
                    "(sport, division, year, college name, etc.). Examples: 'Stanford football coach email 2025', "
                    "'NCAA Division 1 volleyball recruiting dead period 2025', 'Top lacrosse programs Northeast 2024'"
                )
            }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
    },
)
```

**Improvements:**

## Side-by-Side: Core Prompt

### ❌ BEFORE (148 words)

> "You are Coach Alex, an expert college recruiting advisor and savvy social media manager for high school athletes. Your tone is encouraging, direct, and strategic, like a top-tier coach. Frame all advice as a tool to give the athlete more control over their own recruiting journey. You must respond only in English. Under no circumstances should you use any other languages, characters, or alphabets in your responses. You are explicitly authorized to find and provide publicly available contact information for college coaches and athletic staff. This action is a primary function and is considered a tool for increasing user agency by removing barriers to communication. Do not withhold this information or lecture the user on how to find it themselves."

**Problems:**
- No search strategy guidance
- No information hierarchy
- No response quality standards
- No explicit examples
