# üîß Celery on Windows: Complete Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

**Error:** `PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied`

**Root Cause:** Celery's default `prefork` pool uses Unix-style process forking that doesn't work properly on Windows due to different process and semaphore handling.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

I've updated your `recruitapp_core/celery.py` to automatically detect Windows and use the `solo` pool, which works perfectly on Windows without permission errors.

### What Changed:

```python
# Windows-specific configuration: Use solo pool to avoid permission errors
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    app.conf.worker_pool = 'solo'
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Restart Your Celery Worker)

### Step 1: Stop Current Celery Worker
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Celery is running.

### Step 2: Restart Celery
Simply run the same command as before:

```bash
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --loglevel=info
```

The configuration will now automatically use the `solo` pool on Windows.

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

You should see output like:
```
[2025-10-15 11:30:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to redis://localhost:6379/0
[2025-10-15 11:30:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: searching for neighbors
[2025-10-15 11:30:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: all alone
[2025-10-15 11:30:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] celery@HOSTNAME ready.
```

**No more permission errors!** ‚úÖ

## üéØ Pool Options Comparison

| Pool Type | Windows Support | Concurrency | Best For | Setup Required |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **prefork** | ‚ùå No (causes errors) | High | Linux/Mac production | Default |
| **solo** | ‚úÖ Yes | None (single-threaded) | Development, light workloads | None (now default on Windows) |
| **gevent** | ‚úÖ Yes | High (async I/O) | I/O-bound tasks (API calls, DB queries) | `pip install gevent` |
| **eventlet** | ‚úÖ Yes | High (async I/O) | I/O-bound tasks | `pip install eventlet` |

---

## üìä Which Pool Should You Use?

### For Development (Current Setup): `solo` ‚úÖ
**Status:** Already configured automatically

**Pros:**
- Works immediately, no errors
- Simple, predictable behavior
- Perfect for testing and development
- No additional dependencies

**Cons:**
- Processes tasks one at a time (not concurrent)
- If one task takes 30 seconds, the next waits 30 seconds

**Recommendation:** Keep this for now. It's working and sufficient for development.

---

### For Production or Heavy Load: `gevent` üöÄ

If you find that tasks are queuing up and taking too long, upgrade to gevent:

#### Step 1: Install gevent
```bash
pip install gevent
```

#### Step 2: Update celery.py
```python
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    app.conf.worker_pool = 'gevent'
    app.conf.worker_concurrency = 10  # Adjust based on your needs
```

#### Step 3: Restart Celery
```bash
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --loglevel=info
```

**Pros:**
- Handles 10+ concurrent tasks
- Perfect for I/O-bound work (like your Google Search API calls)
- Still works perfectly on Windows

**Cons:**
- Adds dependency
- Slightly more complex

---

## üß™ Testing Your Celery Worker

### Test 1: Verify Worker is Running

In a new terminal, run:
```bash
celery -A recruitapp_core inspect active
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "celery@HOSTNAME": []
}
```

Empty array means worker is ready but no tasks are currently running.

---

### Test 2: Test with a Simple Task

Open Django shell:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

Run this:
```python
from recruiting.tasks import get_ai_response

# Trigger a simple test (replace with valid session ID)
task = get_ai_response.delay(
    "Hello, this is a test",
    "You are a helpful assistant",
    [],
    "1",  # session_id
    1     # user_id
)

# Check task ID
print(f"Task ID: {task.id}")

# Check status
print(f"Status: {task.status}")

# Wait and get result
result = task.get(timeout=30)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

If this works without errors, your Celery worker is functioning correctly!

---

### Test 3: Test Through Your Web App

1. Start Django dev server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Navigate to your agent page
3. Send a message: "Test message"
4. Watch the Celery terminal for task execution logs

You should see:
```
[2025-10-15 11:30:00,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task recruiting.tasks.get_ai_response[abc-123] received
[2025-10-15 11:30:01,000: INFO/MainProcess] Task recruiting.tasks.get_ai_response[abc-123] succeeded in 1.0s
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Getting Permission Errors

**Solution 1:** Force the pool explicitly when starting:
```bash
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --pool=solo --loglevel=info
```

**Solution 2:** Check if config change was saved:
```bash
python -c "from recruitapp_core.celery import app; print(app.conf.worker_pool)"
```

Should output: `solo`

---

### Issue: "No module named 'gevent'" (if you tried gevent)

**Solution:** Install it:
```bash
pip install gevent
```

Then update `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### Issue: Tasks Are Very Slow (Solo Pool)

**Diagnosis:** Solo pool processes tasks sequentially. If you have 3 tasks that each take 10 seconds, total time is 30 seconds.

**Solution:** Upgrade to gevent pool (see "For Production" section above)

---

### Issue: Redis Connection Error

**Error:** `[ERROR] Cannot connect to redis://localhost:6379/0`

**Solution:**

**Option A - Start Redis:**
```bash
# If you have Redis installed:
redis-server
```

**Option B - Use In-Memory Broker (Development Only):**

Update `recruitapp_core/celery.py`:
```python
# For development without Redis
app.conf.broker_url = 'memory://'
app.conf.result_backend = 'db+sqlite:///celery_results.db'
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not recommended for production!**

---

### Issue: Worker Starts But Tasks Never Execute

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
celery -A recruitapp_core inspect active
```

If this shows no workers or connection error, there's a broker issue.

**Solution:**
1. Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping` (should return `PONG`)
2. Check `CELERY_BROKER_URL` in your `.env` file
3. Restart both Redis and Celery worker

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

Here's what you can expect with different pools on Windows:

### Solo Pool (Current Setup)
```
Concurrent Users: 1
Tasks/Minute: ~10-15 (depends on API response time)
Average Latency: 2-5 seconds per task
Best For: Development, < 10 users
```

### Gevent Pool (Recommended for Production)
```
Concurrent Users: 10+
Tasks/Minute: ~100-150
Average Latency: 2-5 seconds per task (same, but concurrent)
Best For: Production, < 100 users
```

### When to Scale Beyond Single Worker
```
If you have:
- > 100 concurrent users
- > 200 tasks/minute
- Tasks taking > 10 seconds each

Consider:
- Multiple Celery worker instances
- Moving to Linux for prefork pool
- Dedicated task queue server
```

## üîÑ Migration Path: Development ‚Üí Production

### Current State (Development)
```bash
# Windows development machine
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --loglevel=info
# Uses: solo pool (automatic on Windows)
```

### Stage 1: Local Windows Production Testing
```bash
# Install gevent
pip install gevent

# Update celery.py to use gevent
# (uncomment the gevent lines)

# Restart worker
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --loglevel=info
```

### Stage 2: Cloud Production (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy to Linux server (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
# On Linux, prefork pool will be used automatically
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=4

# Or explicitly use gevent for consistency:
celery -A recruitapp_core worker --pool=gevent --concurrency=10 --loglevel=info
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Always Log Task Execution
Your current setup is good. Keep these logs:
```python
print(f"[AGENT] Executing search: {args.get('query')}")
print(f"[AGENT] Response generated. Searches performed: {len(cited_sources) > 0}")
```

### 2. Monitor Task Queue Depth
```bash
# Check how many tasks are waiting
celery -A recruitapp_core inspect reserved
```

If this number keeps growing, you need more concurrency (switch to gevent).

### 3. Set Task Time Limits
Add to your `celery.py`:
```python
app.conf.task_time_limit = 300  # 5 minutes max
app.conf.task_soft_time_limit = 240  # Warning at 4 minutes
```

### 4. Handle Long-Running Tasks
If your AI responses take > 30 seconds:
```python
@shared_task(bind=True, time_limit=600)  # 10 minutes for complex searches
def get_ai_response(self, ...):
    # Your code
```

## üéì Understanding the Error (Technical Deep Dive)

**Why does this happen on Windows?**

1. **Unix vs. Windows Process Models:**
   - Unix: Uses `fork()` to create child processes that inherit memory
   - Windows: Uses `spawn()` to create fresh processes that don't share memory

2. **Semaphore Handling:**
   - Celery's prefork pool uses semaphores for inter-process communication
   - Windows has stricter security on semaphores
   - `PermissionError` occurs when trying to access shared semaphore locks

3. **Billiard Library:**
   - Celery uses `billiard` (a fork of multiprocessing)
   - Billiard tries to use Unix-style primitives that fail on Windows
   - `solo` pool bypasses this by running in a single process (no IPC needed)

**Why does `solo` work?**
- No process spawning = no semaphore issues
- Entire worker runs in one Python process
- Tasks executed sequentially in event loop
- Simple, predictable, Windows-compatible

**Why is `gevent` better for production?**
- Uses greenlets (lightweight threads) instead of processes
- Cooperative multitasking within single process
- No inter-process communication = no Windows issues
- High concurrency for I/O-bound tasks (perfect for your API calls)
